# Quantitative Predictive Modeling and Portfolio Risk Optimization on the S&P500

#Overview  
This capstone project demonstrates a full quantitative analysis on S&P500 data, combining statistical modeling, predictive analytics, and portfolio risk optimization. The project showcases the application of optimization, numerical methods—as well as professional Python programming skills for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.  

Key Features  
	•	Data Acquisition & Cleaning: Automated collection and preprocessing of S&P500 historical price data and relevant macroeconomic indicators.  
	•	Exploratory Analysis: Detailed statistical and visual analysis to uncover trends, volatility, and correlations in the market.
	•	Predictive Modeling: Implementation of quantitative models to forecast stock returns, using both classical statistical techniques and machine learning approaches.  
	•	Portfolio Strategy & Optimization: Construction and backtesting of data-driven portfolio strategies with risk-adjusted optimization.
	•	Risk Analysis: Calculation of metrics such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and tail-event analysis to assess potential losses.  

Contents    
	•	PDF Report: Comprehensive description of methodology, results, and conclusions.
	•	Python Source Code: Fully reproducible scripts for data processing, modeling, backtesting, and analysis.  

Purpose
